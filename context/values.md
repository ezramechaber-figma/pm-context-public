### Build Community
We're multiplayer people, and we love the weird, wonderful magic that happens when humans connect. We bring people together so they can bring new ideas to life.
**It means . . .**
1 Creating warm, inclusive spaces where everyone feels welcome
2 Building bridges between Figma and our users
3 Sharing creative projects and obsessions so we can inspire each other.

### Love Your Craft
We build for builders, and try to make complex things feel simple. In our products and process, we invest in the details few people see, but everyone feels.
**It means . . .**
1 Finding joy in the things we make
2 Paring everything down to its essence
3 Making thoughtful trade-offs between business goals and customer needs
4 Using first principles to clarify problems and rethink assumptions

### Run With It
When you see something that needs doing, do it. When you have a great idea, run with it. Tackle big, scary, exciting challenges like Figma's future depends on it. Because it does.
**It means . . .**
1 Taking initiative and being bold
2 Seeking feedback without getting paralyzed by input
3 Hitting deadlines and keeping things moving

### Grow As You Go
Everyone's a work in progress, and we're here to help each other grow. So along with ❤️ and 💯, we share the direct feedback we all need to become great at what we do.
**It means . . .**
1 Staying humble and curious
2 Having the courage to give and get constructive feedback
3 Remaining optimistic when things get tough
4 Being flexible and embracing ambiguity

### Play
Playing is learning. We embrace spontaneous, unstructured exploration—because that's where we find our best ideas.
**It means…**
1 Making time to experiment and imagine
2 Valuing inputs as much as outputs
3 Finding ways to bring fun and lightness into work
