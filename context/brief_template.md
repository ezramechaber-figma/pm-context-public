# Product Brief 

## What problem are you solving and why?

*// TODO: What is the problem you’re solving, or opportunities you’re pursuing? What kind of customer are you targeting? What insights are you operating on? Why do you think we’d do this better than the competition?*
Link to customer conversations or research that help clarify the problem, and try to articulate this in less than 250 words.

## What are you thinking of building?
*// TODO: In short, describe the feature/product you’re trying to build, ideally with an illustrative user journey. We know the execution can and will change, so focus on giving a sense of what could be built that will elicit a reaction from people. If you truly don’t know what you’re building, describe the solution at the highest level possible. If you have ideas about interactions this will introduce, prototype them with Figma Make and link to your Make here.*

## Why might you not build this?

*// TODO: What might be potentially controversial about what you’re building? Imagine a Figmate pushing back on this; why might that be? (Examples: maybe you’re trading off a bit of community good will for a business goal; maybe you’re adding a new primitive or item to the IA that could complicate the experience; maybe you’re prioritizing one audience over another.) What are some risks? What are you most scared of?*

## What does success look like?

*// TODO: What metrics are you trying to move, and what are the desired outcomes? (If you’re unsure of metrics, what would you minimally want to qualitatively observe?)*
